# cashu-redeem

This is a stand-alone open-source demo of the [Nostrly Cashu Redeem Tool](https://www.nostrly.com/cashu-redeem/).

The main script was originally written for use in a WordPress plugin, which is why it uses Javascript / jQuery.

This standalone demo can be run by opening the index.html file in a browser.


## Dev

To install the required packages, run:

```
npm i
```

## Build

Changes to src/main.js can be packaged and saved to public/nostrly-cashu.min.js by running:

```
npm run build
```

## Disclaimer

Cashu is still new so don't use it for money you would worry about losing. This project was just a weekend hack and could have bugs that lose your money.
